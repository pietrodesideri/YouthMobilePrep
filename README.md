## The Mobile Application
 The YouthMobile Prep is a mobile application targeted at aspiring youthmobile students to primarily have a theoretical grasp of the basics of web languages (HTML, CSS and JavaScript) and perhaps, put into practice the theoretical knowledge.

 The application requires no internet connection to access its core functionalities. However, users would require internet connection on their device to access external resources.

## Installing The Application on Mobile Device
  For now, the application is installable on Android devices only. The apk file is available in this repository for download. 

  The IOS version would be available later.
